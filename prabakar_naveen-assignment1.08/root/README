For this assignment, I added in a couple of new methods to:
item.h and file.h . The new methods transform the text descriptions
to objects for to be put onto the map.

Once they are put onto the map, the color is rendered during the
printing part of the dungeon. Some other changes are: pressing on
'o' opens monsters that are on the map not from textfile.
'i' opens items that are on the map not from text file.

To run the following program just run: ./hw8
