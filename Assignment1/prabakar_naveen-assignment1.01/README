For this assignment, I followed the algorithm described in the assignment directions. I first placed down 6
random rooms in the board, then iterated through the array and carved paths to the center of each room. I 
used the center of the room and it kept going until it hit the center of the room, then moved to the next
room. I randomly placed two stairs on the map as well, and the PC. I also assigned a hardness to each tile
on the board.
