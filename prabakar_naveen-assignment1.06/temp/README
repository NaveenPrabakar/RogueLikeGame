Created 4 header files (Monster, Player, Stairs, Rooms) to turn the structs to classes.
All the structs have been converted to classes (exception is the Node for the heap,
that's allowed to stay a struct).  

Teleport uses * pointer

f for fog of war

to run the program do: ./hw6 {number of monsters}, it will intially start with fog of war
